Practing multithreading programming by Stepik course (https://stepik.org/course/149)

All of the topics has the own `README` and runtime `.GIF` with the result of the program. Be free in checking each directory.

## Tasks list

There are some simple and some **interesting** in my opinion tasks. **Interesting** tasks marked with **bold** formatting.

    * Derivative of polynomial
    * Simple smart pointer
    * Simple allocator with memory blocks control

3. [Berkeley sockets. Multiplexing.](/3_Berkeley-sockets_Multiplexing):
    * Simple echo server
    * **Messenger with Select function**
    * **Messenger with Poll function**

4. Async I/O: there is no tasks, only quick event libraries overview:
